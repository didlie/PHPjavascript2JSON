index.php:
==========
CONVERTS JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS, OBJECTS ET.AL. IN THE TEXT AREA TO JSON ON FORM SUBMISSION.

THIS ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF EVAL() TO ASSIGN THE FUNCTION NAME TO window, and the function
value to that function.

SINGLE FILE EXECUTABLE.

FEEL FREE TO FORK AND UPGRADE. 

! CHALLENGE: MAKE THIS WORK WITH JAVASCRIPT SINGLETON FUNCTIONS.

PLUG AND PLAY INDEX.PHP
------------------------------------------------------------

index2.php:
===========
ALLOWS FOR USER INPUT TO THE TEXT FIELD, WHERE THE FILE IS SAVED IN THE INDEX DIRECTORY
THEN IN THE SAME PROCESS IT IS SENT BACK TO THE PAGE AS RESPONSE TO FETCH, AND THEN
EVALUATED USING eval(). FOR THIS TO WORK, THE FUNCTION MUST BE WRITTEN AS:
window.functionName = function(){ ... }.

SOME CORE CONCEPTS HERE ARE THE USE OF php://input INSTEAD OF $_POST ON THE SERVERSIDE,
THE USE OF eval() TO CREATE A window.functionName AND window.varValue, AND COORDINATION
OF SERVERSIDE javascript.js FILES RECEIVED VIA fetch()
